## 6. <a href =  'https://agricolamz.github.io/The_Circassian_Isoglosses_Database/6.html'>cardinals end in</a>
### Description

The numerals with meaning like "N times" are formed by attaching the suffix -e. The fractional numerals are analysed ro be formed by attaching -ne to the previous numerals (i.e. by attaching -e-ne). In such forms the e~a alternation works, so the end in -ane (thus we suppose that these suffixes are in the stem). The cardinal numerals are analysed to be formed with the prefix ja- [3pl.io.poss] and the suffix -re, but the vowel a is substituted by the vowel e (how we can analyse it in terms of the stem border?). In Bzhedug in such forms the vowel alternation is remained in -ane (thus we suppose that -re is not in the stem)
